# About Me
My name is Evan Gray, and I'm currently a Ruby on Rails developer at [Public
Strategies](https://github.com/publicstrategies). In most places, I go by the
handle evanthegrayt.

I started my career in 2007 as a someone who imported image and data files from
a CD to my company's imaging system, hardly knowing anything about computers.
Since then, I've gathered knowledge about many different aspects of computer
science, and finally found my passion for software development in 2016, when I
learned ruby and eventually rails.

I would say I'm self taught, but that wouldn't be fair to the awesome friends
and coworkers I've had over the last decade and a half that have helped me learn
and become the developer I am today.

When I'm coding for fun, I enjoy building tools that solve a problem I'm
experiencing, and releasing it in hopes that it might also help others with the
same issues. Lately, I've been learning VimScript and building plugins for my
favorite editor.
