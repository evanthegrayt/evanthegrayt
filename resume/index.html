          <ul class="list duties">
            <li>
              I serve as Engineer, Product Owner, and Scrum Master for a team
              developing and maintaining a client-facing Ruby on Rails portal,
              managing user stories, backlog prioritization, and code quality.
              I collaborate with cross-functional teams to plan the deprecation
              of 10+ legacy systems written in C, C++, PHP, and others,
              consolidating codebases and streamlining workflows. I lead Scrum
              ceremonies to drive iterative progress, organize weekly sessions
              on coding best practices, and work with executives to align the
              product roadmap with business needs.
            </li>

            <li>
              As the Product Engineer for an offshore contractor team, I led
              the development of a web-based pysical-file check-in system,
              integrating Python, Django, and NuxtJS with revenue-critical
              legacy systems. I architected user-centric features, made
              strategic tech decisions, and aligned product outcomes with
              business goals. After the successful launch, the local team took
              over development of the project, and I now serve as the technical
              owner.

              My primary focus was building a robust Rails API to support

              rewards, and program content. I collaborated with stakeholders to
              determine product requirements and frequently engaged in the

              performance by establishing a Jira workflow, implementing Agile

              developing comprehensive documentation.

            <li>
              I started on the Ads team, which helped businesses create and
              manage ad campaigns via a Rails admin. My key achievement was
              implementing a RESTful API using Graphiti, which translated
              requests into GraphQL through a custom adapter, enabling
              efficient CRUD operations on our internal Ad Server.
            </li>

            <li>
              After completing my work with the Ads team, I was reassigned to a
              team focused on revamping the user experience for the site and
              native apps. Despite the brief duration, I made significant
              contributions, particularly in addressing technical debt for the
              "Best of Weedmaps" campaign in 2022.
            </li>

            <li>
              My short time here was unfortunately due to a company-wide layoff
              that eventually impacted about forty percent of employees.

            <li>
              I developed various web applications for contracted clients,
              primarily in the social services sector. Initially working with
              Laravel, we later transitioned to Ruby on Rails. As a back-end
              developer, I worked on a Rails API with a React and TypeScript
              front end, while also maintaining the admin layer through a
              traditional Rails UI.
            </li>

            <li>
              The applications managed and visualized data through custom
              reporting, displayed content like webinars and podcasts,
              organized events in a calendar, and allowed clients to upload and
              display organizational information. Each site included an admin
              layer for Technical Assistance representatives to manage all
              content and data across the platform.
            </li>

            <li>
              I was often responsible for training new members of the back-end
              team during onboarding. I also created

                that helped our Vim users standardize their code, and also
                extended Vim’s functionality, such as templating, DB
                connections on a per-project basis, and testing endpoints.

              I began my software engineering career building desktop
              applications with Ruby GTK, using the Ruleby rules engine for
              task flow and delegating asynchronous tasks to a Redis server. I
              also maintained C and PHP legacy applications, occasionally
              porting them to Ruby.
            </li>

            <li>
              Towards the end of my time at ADFITECH, I worked on the company’s
              client-facing web app built in Ruby on Rails. The platform
              enabled clients to upload data and images and respond to findings
              from our Quality Control team.
            </li>

            <li>
              I eventually took on the responsibility of teaching junior
              developers to write Object-Oriented code in Ruby. I created a
              training repository where new hires could learn our issue
              workflow, submit merge requests via GitLab, and familiarize
              themselves with the command line and common development tools
              like Git.

              I briefly transitioned into the role of Jr. Linux System
              Administrator, handling daily maintenance tasks like checking
              logs, sudo reports, and ensuring the surveillance system
              functioned properly. I also managed MacOS administration for
              developers using MacBooks and took on special projects and
              escalated tickets from the Technical Support desk.
            </li>

            <li>
              During this time, I received the "Shining Star" (employee of the
              month) award for successfully completing a major project for a
              high-profile client. The project involved setting up
              client-provided PCs for our employees, enabling custom security
              software and RSA, and repairing any PCs damaged during shipping.

              After rejoining ADFITECH, I was promoted to the selections

              audited based on government standards and client requests. I was
              also responsible for importing the relevant data into the system
              once selections were made.
            </li>

            <li>
              I wrote and maintained client-specific scripts to ensure
              selections met client specifications. Over time, I refined the
              process, enabling non-technical users to manage it by editing
              configuration files. This improvement led to my promotion to Jr.
              System Administrator.

              technical issues, including printers, Thin Clients, email,
              password resets, and other common problems. I was also
              responsible for setting up user workspaces, including running and
              terminating CAT-5 and phone cables.
            </li>

            <li>
              I used this opportunity to automate tasks with command-line and
              shell scripting, significantly reducing the time spent resolving
              user issues and, in some cases, enabling users to fix problems
              independently.

              opportunity to join the IT team. ADFITECH was transitioning from
              paper loan audits to digital images, and I was responsible for
              converting and importing image files sent via SFTP, CDs, or hard
              drives into the proper format. This marked the beginning of a new

            <li>
              During this time, I learned to use the terminal, write shell

              As the workload grew, I also trained new department members, many
