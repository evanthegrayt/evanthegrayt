            Having worked in various areas of the technological landscape since
            2007, I've found that my true passion lies in programming, which I
            have been doing since 2015. I love to express myself through code;
            I feel it's important to have creative outlets, and Iâ€™m grateful
            every day to be able to do something I'm so passionate about for a
            living.

          <ul class="list duties">
            <li>
              At Public Strategies, I built a variety of web applications of
              varying complexity for contracted clients, mostly in the
              government space. When I first joined, these sites were written
              in PHP and Laravel, but eventually, we switched to Ruby on Rails.
              I was primarily a back end developer, as we had our repositories
              split into a Rails API back end and a React and TypeScript front
              end. The back end team was usually also responsible for the admin
              layer, which was a traditional Rails UI.
            </li>

            <li>
              The applications I built were responsible for managing and
              visualizing data via custom reporting, displaying content such
              as webinars and podcasts, organizing and displaying upcoming and
              past events via a calendar, and allowing clients to upload
              information about their organization and displaying it in a
              meaningful way. The sites typically had an admin layer, which
              allows our Technical Assistance representatives to manage all
              content and data displayed across the site.
            </li>

            <li>
              I was often responsible for training new members of the back end
              team during on-boarding. I truly enjoy teaching people, and
              Public Strategies was the second company to empower me to do so.

                a plugin
              </a>
              that helped our Vim users standardize their code, and also
              extended Vim and some of its plugins' functionality, such as text
              templating, database connections on a per-project basis, and
              testing API endpoints.

          <ul class="list duties">
            <li>
              Due to my fondness for scripting, I eventually requested a
              transfer to a developer role. I started by learning how to build
              desktop applications for end-users with Ruby GTK. These
              applications had a task flow determined by the Ruleby rules
              engine, and delegated asynchronous tasks to a Redis server. I
              also was expected to maintain C and PHP legacy applications when
              necessary, sometimes porting them to Ruby.
            </li>

            <li>
              Near the end of my time at Adfitech, I started working on the
              company's web app for clients, which was built in Ruby on Rails.
              The website allowed for clients to upload data and images to our
              system, and respond to findings from our Quality Control team.
            </li>

            <li>
              Eventually, I was responsible for teaching entry-level developers
              programming concepts and how to write Object-Oriented code in
              Ruby. I implemented a training repository, where new-hires could
              learn our process for working issues and submitting merge
              requests via GitLab. This repository also taught them the basics
              of the command-line and a few other common development tools,
              such as git.
            </li>

          <ul class="list duties">
            <li>
              For a short time, I transitioned into the role of a Jr. Linux
              System Administrator. I was expected to handle daily system
              maintenance tasks, such as checking logs and sudo reports,
              ensuring the surveillance system was functional, and running
              reports when we had security issues. I also handled MacOS
              administration and maintenance; a lot of our developers ran
              MacBooks and our Linux admins weren't fond of managing them. I
              also handled special projects, and tickets escalated from the
              Technical Support desk.
            </li>

            <li>
              During this time, I received the "Shining Star" (employee of the
              month) award for successfully completing a large project for a
              very high-profile client. The project included setting up PCs
              provided by the client for our employees to use, enabling custom
              security software and RSA, and repairing any PCs that were
              damaged during shipping.

          <ul class="list duties">
            <li>
              My first promotion after rejoining Adfitech saw me moved to the
              selections department. I was responsible for picking the correct
              number of each type of loan to be audited, according to
              government standards and client requests. Once selections were
              made, I was then responsible for getting the relevant data
              imported into the system.
            </li>

            <li>
              While in this department, I wrote and maintained scripts on a
              per-client basis, ensuring that the client's specifications for
              selections were met. I also refined the process over time,
              allowing me to pass the responsibilities to a user who didn't
              need to understand the coding aspect and only needed to edit
              configuration files. This is what earned me the promotion to Jr.
              System Administrator.

          <ul class="list duties">
            <li>
              After a brief leave from Adfitech, I rejoined the team in the
              Business and I.T. Specialist department (BITS). I was expected to
              handle day to day user-related technical problems, such as
              printers, Thin Clients, email, password resets, and other common
              issues. We were also responsible for setting up user workspaces,
              including running and tipping CAT-5 and phone cables.
            </li>

            <li>
              I also used this as an opportunity to automate tasks using my
              command-line and shell-scripting knowledge. This substantially
              decreased the time it took to help users with certain issues, and
              in some cases, allowed the users to fix issues themselves.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="list duties">
            <li>
              Initially hired as a shipping/receiving clerk, I was soon given
              an opportunity to learn about technology due to being recognized
              as someone who was a hard worker and quickly grasped new
              concepts. At the time, Adfitech was transitioning from auditing
              paper loans to using digital images of the loans. Clients would
              either transfer images to us via SFTP, or send CDs or hard drives
              with image files on them, and I was responsible for getting those
              images into the proper format and importing them into the system.
              This was the start of a new sub-division of the IT department,
              and we named it "Electron."
            </li>

            <li>
              During this time, I learned how to use the terminal, write shell
              scripts to help automate tedious processes, and was introduced to
              Vim. As the workload increased, I was also responsible for
              training people who were new to the department and often had no
              previous technical experience.
