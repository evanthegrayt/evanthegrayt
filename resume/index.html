            With nine years of IT experience total, my true passion lies in
            programming, which I have been doing for approximately four years. I
            love to express myself through code, and derive great satisfaction
            from building applications that help people do their job more
            efficiently. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, and
            continue gaining knowledge of different technologies at a company
            that values quality and dedication.
