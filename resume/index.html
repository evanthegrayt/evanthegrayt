              As a result of my successful work with the Data team, I was
              promoted to the role of Product Software Engineer &amp; Data Team
              Manager. In this capacity, I oversaw the implementation and
              maintenance of our company's internal data management system,
              which comprised a large, data-intensive component built in Rails,
              as well as event management and marketing modules that utilized
              our MS D365 implementation.
            </li>

            <li>
              In this role, I collaborated closely with stakeholders to gain a
              deep understanding of user needs. Drawing on this knowledge, I
              designed the software architecture and ensured that all product
              features were properly implemented. I continued to write
              technical documentation, define processes, and foster
              interdepartmental communication to promote a cohesive work
              environment.

            <li>
              My initial focus centered around constructing a robust Rails API
              that would serve mobile applications. These apps provided users
              with easy access to their schedule, rewards achieved for
              attending events, as well as content and information about the
              program. Much of my time was allocated towards consolidating
              resources and eliciting product requirements by engaging with
              stakeholders. While coding, I often found myself delving into the
              configuration layer, leveraging my expertise to troubleshoot and
              configure various aspects of the application for DevOps.
            </li>

            <li>
              As a result of our diligent attention to both product and
              process, a project manager and I redirected our focus to
              supporting the data team. They were tasked with consolidating
              numerous data management systems into a unified instance of MS
              Dynamics, but required assistance in overcoming technical
              knowledge gaps and streamlining processes. Our contributions were
              critical in optimizing the team's performance by setting up an
              efficient workflow in Jira, implementing Agile methodologies,
              fostering interdepartmental communication, and creating
              comprehensive documentation.

            <li>
              I began my tenure on the Ads team, which was responsible for
              facilitating businesses in creating and administering advertising
              campaigns on our platform through a user-friendly Rails admin. My
              most notable achievement entailed completing the implementation
              of a RESTful API, built on Graphiti, which translated requests
              into GraphQL via a custom adapter. This allowed for easy
              management and control of CRUD actions on our internal Ad Server.
            </li>

            <li>
              Following the successful completion of my work with the Ads team,
              the organization underwent a restructure, and I was placed on a
              new team responsible for revamping the user experience for both
              the site and native applications. Although my time in this role
              was brief, my contributions proved significant, particularly in
              addressing technical debt for the highly-anticipated "Best of
              Weedmaps" campaign of 2022.
            </li>

            <li>
              My short time here was unfortunately due to a company-wide layoff
              that impacted about twenty-five percent of employees.

          <ul class="list duties">
            <li>
              I built a variety of web applications of varying complexity for
              contracted clients, mostly in the government space. When I first
              joined, these sites were written in PHP and Laravel, but
              eventually, we switched to Ruby on Rails. I was primarily a back
              end developer, as we had our repositories split into a Rails API
              back end and a React and TypeScript front end. The back end team
              was also responsible for the admin layer, which was a traditional
              Rails UI.
            </li>

            <li>
              The applications were responsible for managing and visualizing
              data via custom reporting, displaying content such as webinars
              and podcasts, organizing and displaying upcoming and past events
              via a calendar, and allowing clients to upload information about
              their organization and displaying it in a meaningful way. The
              sites typically had an admin layer, which allows our Technical
              Assistance representatives to manage all content and data
              displayed across the site.
            </li>

            <li>
              I was often responsible for training new members of the back end
              team during on-boarding. I truly enjoy teaching people, and this
              was the second company to empower me to do so.

              that helped our Vim users standardize their code, and also
              extended Vim and some of its plugins' functionality, such as text
              templating, database connections on a per-project basis, and
              testing API endpoints.

              Due to my knack for scripting, I eventually transitioned to a
              developer role. I began learning how to build desktop
              applications for our internal end-users with Ruby GTK. These
              applications had a task flow determined by the Ruleby rules
              engine, and delegated asynchronous tasks to a Redis server. I was
              also expected to maintain C and PHP legacy applications when
              necessary, sometimes porting them to Ruby.
            </li>

            <li>
              Near the end of my time at Adfitech, I started working on the
              company's web app for clients, which was built in Ruby on Rails.
              The website allowed for clients to upload data and images to our
              system, and respond to findings from our Quality Control team.
            </li>

            <li>
              Eventually, I was responsible for teaching entry-level developers
              programming concepts and how to write clean Object-Oriented code
              in Ruby. I implemented a training repository, where new-hires
              could learn our process for working issues and submitting merge
              requests via GitLab. This repository also taught them the basics
              of the command-line and a few other common development tools,
              such as git.

              For a short time, I transitioned into the role of a Jr. Linux
              System Administrator. I was expected to handle daily system
              maintenance tasks, such as checking logs and sudo reports,
              ensuring the surveillance system was functional, and running
              reports when we had security issues. I also handled MacOS
              administration and maintenance; a lot of our developers ran
              MacBooks and our Linux admins weren't fond of managing them. I
              also handled special projects, and tickets escalated from the
              Technical Support desk.
            </li>

            <li>
              During this time, I received the "Shining Star" (employee of the
              month) award for successfully completing a large project for a
              very high-profile client. The project included setting up PCs
              provided by the client for our employees to use, enabling custom
              security software and RSA, and repairing any PCs that were
              damaged during shipping.

              My first promotion after rejoining Adfitech moved me to the

              correct number of each type of loan to be audited, according to
              government standards and client requests. Once selections were
              made, I was then responsible for importing the relevant data into
              the system.
            </li>

            <li>
              I wrote and maintained scripts on a per-client basis, ensuring
              that the client's specifications for selections were met. I also
              refined the process over time, allowing me to pass the
              responsibilities to a user who didn't need to understand the
              coding aspect and only needed to edit configuration files. This
              is what earned me the promotion to Jr. System Administrator.

              After a brief leave from Adfitech, I rejoined the team in the

              printers, Thin Clients, email, password resets, and other common
              issues. We were also responsible for setting up user workspaces,

            <li>
              I also used this as an opportunity to automate tasks using my

              decreased the time it took to help users with certain issues, and
              in some cases, allowed the users to fix issues themselves.

            <li>
              Initially hired as a shipping/receiving clerk, I was soon given
              an opportunity to learn about technology due to being recognized
              as someone who was a hard worker and quickly grasped new
              concepts. At the time, Adfitech was transitioning from auditing
              paper loans to using digital images of the loans. Clients would
              either transfer images to us via SFTP, or send CDs or hard drives
              with image files on them, and I was responsible for getting those
              images into the proper format and importing them into the system.
              This was the start of a new sub-division of the IT department,

              training people who were new to the department and often had no
